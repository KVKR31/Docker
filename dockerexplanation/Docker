### Docker 

What is Docker ??
* Docker: Docker is a platform that allows you to package and run applications in isolated Containers.

What is docker and Why it is used ?
 * Docker lets you build, test, and deploy applications quickly.

What is docker Containers ?
* A Docker Container is a lightwheight standlone and executable package that contains everthing needed to run an applications.it include the code,runtime systemtools libraries and dependies .

* Docker has Three Modes 
   1 . Attached mode  (-a)
   2 . Detached Mode   (-d)
   3 . Interactive Mode (-it)

In attached and detached mode when we run container it exicted/dead automatically 
* attached mode use to rectifie the mistakes what container because it directly connect to the container . 
* When we run the container in detached mode it run the container in demon set means it run the container in backgroung .
* When we run the container in -it means interactive mode it directly enter in to the container and it show the container full details if we run the container usint interactive mode it dead/exicted from the container .

* -p means port (when we keep -p we need to mention some port to container
For example if nginx run's in 80 port then we need to forford the port to 80:8080 it is also called as port forwarding)

* -P using this symble we did not  give any port to contianer it only take settern port and give to the user

### Dteached mode
`docker container run -d -P --name <NAme> image name`
`docker container run -d -p <forward the port> --name <NAme> image name`

## detached mode
`docker container run -it -P --name <NAme> image name`
`docker container run -it -p <forward the port> --name <NAme> image name`

### atached mode
`docker container run -P --name <NAme> image name` ### in this -a ifare ifelse we give/not it take automatically
`docker container run -p <forward the port> --name <NAme> image name`

### to go to running container use
`docker container exec -it <container name> /bin/bash`

### Docker installation

* Go do dockerscript official page and use :
`curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh`
`sudo sh install-docker.sh`
`sudo usermod =aG docker ubuntu`

* After using above three commands exit from linux machine and login again then see where docker is connect to ubuntu to are not using

`docker version`

* Using above commands docker installation done scussesfully 


### Dockerfile to SpringetClinc

"FROM amazoncorretto:11
Label author="vinod"
RUN curl -fsSL https://referenceapplicationskhaja.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar -o spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ("java" "-jar" /spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar -o spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar)"



* To remove docker container use
  * `docker container rm -f Containername/ID`
  * `docker container rm -f $(docker container ls -aq)` ## To remove all container use this .
* To remove docker image use   
  * `docker image rm -f imagename/ID`
  * `docker image rm -f $(docker image ls -aq)`

* To set alias in linux machine For examples :
  * alias rmi='docker image rm -f '$(docker image ls -a)` ## To delete the IMages 
  * alias rmc='docker container rm -f '$(docker container ls -a)` ### to delete container
